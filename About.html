            History<br>
            Founded by Bruce McLaren in 1963, McLaren was<br>
             on the path to building its first racecar in the first year.<br>
              The first ever McLaren model was the McLaren M1A,<br>
               which saw just 24 models produced. Later, the M1B emerged<br>
                and entered the Can-Am championship, earning 43<br>
                 victories and besting rival Porsche on the season.<br>
                  By 1965, McLaren had constructed their first Formula 1 entry,<br>
             debuting at the legendary Monaco Grand Prix.
